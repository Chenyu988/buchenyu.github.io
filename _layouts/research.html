  <p class="paper-description">
In this paper I develop a version of musical formalism inspired by Schopenhauer. First, I present a Schopenhauerian account of music with a background of his metaphysical framework. Then, I define meaningfulness as an analog to a Kantian notion of purposiveness and argue that, in light of Schopenhauer, music is meaningful as a direct manifestation of the universal will. Given the ineffable nature of what music points to, its form lacks any representation of meaning. Music is therefore the mere form of meaningfulness, and it is precisely this mere form that gives rise to the infinite possibilities to ascribe it with a variety of musical meaning. </p>

<h3 class="paper-title">A paper arguing for a methodological shift in musical ontology</h3>

<div class="paper-abstract">
  <p class="paper-description">
This paper raises some skepticism about the centrality of musical works in ontological debates in the philosophy of music. It argues that such a focus imposes conceptual and methodological limitations in investigating the nature of <em>music</em>. As an alternative to the work-oriented methodology, the paper proposes a shift toward an ontological framework centered on <em>musical elements</em> and the various structures they compose. This alternative approach allows us to pursue our philosophical interests about music without running into the familiar puzzles about work ontology.

<div class="paper-abstract">
  <p class="paper-description">
This paper purports to define generativity by developing a formal account of generative operations. Formulated within the framework of higher-order logic with plural types and a Finean notion of essence, the theory articulates precisely what makes an operation genuinely <em>generative</em> in terms of the identity dependency of the output object on the inputs and the generative process. The proposal aims to account for a range of cases, from the paradigmatic examples favored by the generativist (such as set-building and structural abstraction) to more 'esoteric' objects (propositions, artworks, social objects, etc.) and to unify them under the same generative principles.

  <p class="paper-description">
This paper defends musical formalism by proposing a novel account of <em>musical form</em>, according to which a form is a relational structure that not only describes music’s formal qualities but generates meaning as well. By elucidating an essential connection between the formal and the affective aspects of music, this approach may realize the formalist dream: it reconciles a traditionally held opposition between structural analysis and subjective interpretation while explaining music's significance—in a formalist way.

  <p class="paper-description">
This paper explains how one can be a platonist about music, that is, how music can be construed as abstract entities that exist independently from us. It argues that the fact that musical objects (intervals, chords, motifs, melodies, etc.) are multiply manifestable, diversely identifiable, and compositional provides strong support for a platonist view about such things. A principle of ontological inheritance is then introduced and motivated to extend platonism from basic musical elements to more complex structures, resulting in a view on which all musical objects (including works and improvisations) are platonic. It concludes by making an attempt to adjudicate between different versions of musical platonism, showing the theoretical fruitfulness of adopting a generativist framework.

  <p class="paper-description">
This paper revisits a well-known impossibility result concerning the logical representation of unawareness within classical epistemic frameworks, originally formulated in response to attempts to model agents’ awareness levels. It offers an alternative approach that treats unawareness as a failure of content-recognition rather than of truth evaluation, and does so by drawing on insights from weak Kleene logic. The proposed framework preserves classical reasoning where possible, while accommodating a finer-grained distinction between knowledge, ignorance, and unawareness.

  <p class="paper-description">
In the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant identifies space and time as the only two pure forms of sensible intuition of a priori cognition. He constructs the three essential arguments for space and time mainly based on the investigations of visual information: how we form visual representations of objects, of their relations to each other in space, and of their changes and motions in time. The neglect of auditory representations in this discussion, however, is a regrettable state of affairs, as the spatial and temporal unfolding of sound could initiate another discussion of the Transcendental Aesthetic. My task in this paper is to reconstruct Kant's arguments in the Transcendental Aesthetic in the context of a pure auditory perception. The re-evaluations and reconstruction process of the three essential arguments in the Transcendental Aesthetic will lead to the conclusion that our representation of sounds precisely comes from our representation of space and time as a priori and pure intuitions.

  <p class="paper-description">
In <em>Being and Nothingness</em>, Sartre presents nothingness as the foundation for being and the origin of its nihilation, i.e. the non-being. In this paper, I will extend the notion of nothingness beyond the paradigm of being to the world of sound and discuss silence as a sonic state to approach the experience of Sartrean nothingness in the context of contemporary classical music. After a reconstruction of Sartre’s deduction for nothingness, I will introduce the concept of sound with respect to the total sound-space bound by our pure auditory experience. Silence, then, is the non-being of sound which is originated from Sartrean nothingness. The following distinction between absolute and relative silence will then lead to a further discussion of the relation of sound to silence as analogous to the relation of being to non-being. Remarking that the silence has been approached by different techniques in music, I will focus on contemporary repertoires and analyze the role of silence in the third movement of <em>Five Pieces for Orchestra</em> by Anton Webern and <em>4’33”</em> by John Cage as an embodiment of nothingness in the sound-space.
